========================
This is an app that was created and deployed during the ARC Education and Communication subcommittee conference call on Jan. 5, 2014.
The purpose was to show how to create a local testing environment that could be used for simple data visualization training sessions provided by the Analyst Resource Center. These training sessions will have the goal of increasing the public's awareness of, and access to, data contained in the <a href="http://www.workforceinfodb.org/index.cfm">Workforce Information Database.</a>
You can see the live version at http://arc-wid-test3.meteor.com
Future iterations of this will include WID data, and will use charts that pull data from a separate file (tsv or csv) or connect to a database.
